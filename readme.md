# Tea Cozy
This is a project based off of an Off-Platform Project that is part of the [Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/full-stack-engineer/paths/fscj-22-web-development-foundations/tracks/fscj-22-making-a-website-responsive/modules/wdcp-22-layout-with-flexbox-8a62abed-21fe-442a-8d4d-2b84f3d4ee3a/projects/tea-cozy).

This project required me to work to a [design spec](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg). Using the provided image I had to work out which styling to use and which CSS Flexbox properties to set.
